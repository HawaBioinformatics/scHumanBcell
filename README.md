scMouseBcellFlu

This is the repository associated with the single cell RNA analysis after respiratory influenza virus infection reveals spatiotemporal dynamics of B cell subtypes.
This repository contains the code and supporting files necessary to reproduce the analyses reported for the prokect. In essence, the anlaysis workflow herein was done using the Seurat analysis philosophy.

Single-cell RNA-seq analysis

To re-run the analysis of the scRNA-Seq data, the necessary workflow and scripts can be found in the scripts/scRNAseq_pipeline/ subdirectory.

Cluster annotaion and analysis

Scripts necessary to reproduce the analysis of the B-cell sequencing data can be found in the scripts/VDJ_analysis/ subdirectory.
