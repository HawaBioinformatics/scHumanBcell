# scHumanBcellFlu

This is the repository associated with the single cell RNA analysis after respiratory influenza A viral infection analysis. *This pipeline reveals the dynamics of B cell sub-type responses.*

The repository contains the code and supporting files necessary to reproduce the analyses reported for the project. In essence, the analysis workflow herein was done using the Seurat analysis pipeline.

## Single-cell RNA-seq analysis, Cluster annotation and analysis

Scripts and workflow necessary to reproduce the scRNA-Seq analysis can be found in the [scHumanBcellFlu/analysis](https://github.com/HawaBioinformatics/scHumanBcellFlu/tree/main/analysis) sub-directory.
